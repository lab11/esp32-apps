# Time Sync

This example demonstrates time synchronization over BLE. 

The <!--`central`--> app connects to Wi-Fi to retrieve current time over SNTP, and then connects with compatible peripherals to update their clocks. 

<!-- The `peripheral` app acts as a compatible BLE device that connects to central for time synchronization. -->
