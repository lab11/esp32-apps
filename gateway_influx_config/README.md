# Simple HTTP Server Example 

Sets up a simple HTTP server on the ESP32 that is accessible locally on the connected Wi-Fi network. 

Content is served at the device's IP address and should be viewable from any browser on the network.

The address is advertised as an mDNS service on the network, in addition to being logged on the serial monitor during startup.
