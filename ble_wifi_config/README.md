BLE Wi-Fi Configuration
=======================

Provides a BLE service for configuring the board's Wi-Fi connection.

When the app runs, it uses the Eddystone protocol to point nearby phones to a [web interface](www) where users can specify the appropriate Wi-Fi network & credentials.

The interface must be opened in [Summon](https://github.com/lab11/summon) or a Web Bluetooth-enabled browser to facilitate the configuration over BLE.
